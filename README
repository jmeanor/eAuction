eAuction is an HTML/JavaScript/PHP-based auction site. It includes user profiles, customizable auction templates, and searching. It uses the jQuery and Highcharts plugins for expanded functionality. PHP 5.4 was used, and using any version < 5.3 or >= 5.5 may result in unforseen issues.

The inc folder has all of the site-wide includes files. db.php is defined here, and sets up the connection to the database. PDO is used throughout the site. The connection to the database works as follows:
   server: localhost
   user: eauction
   password: 75FCPJAtFrTTvT8
   database: eauction
The eauction user must have permissions for CREATE and DROP as well as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. The database design was created using MySQL Server 5.5.36, and earlier or later versions may have unforseen issues. The folder sql_dump includes a .sql script that can set up the database with the default data.

The shop folder includes all of the pages relating to the selling of items. The user folder contains all the pages relating to the users, as well as the administrative tasks.
